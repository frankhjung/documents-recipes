My favorite food recipes.

Why?
----

Because food is wonderful!

These recipes have been collected over the years. They are being constantly
modified to my tastes. I do prefer if recipes are simple enough to be enjoyable
without being overly taxing in preparation. Interesting spices and vegetables
are a bonus. But, ultimately it is all about the taste!

So please, enjoy!

How To - Write a New Recipe
---------------------------

I use LibreOffice to write these recipes from a template (*_recipe.ott*) and
save them in Open Document Format. To share them would export as a PDF, but
most of my friends now use LibreOffice, so sending ODF is much less of a
problem.
